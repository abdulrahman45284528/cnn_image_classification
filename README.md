# 🖼️ CNN Image Classification with PyTorch

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch to classify images from **MNIST**, **Fashion-MNIST**, and **CIFAR-10** datasets. The model achieves high accuracy and supports training on GPUs for fast performance.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Train a CNN model on three popular datasets:  
- 🖊️ **MNIST** – Handwritten digits  
- 👕 **Fashion-MNIST** – Clothing items  
- 🚗 **CIFAR-10** – Real-world objects  

✅ Uses PyTorch-based **data augmentation** for CIFAR-10  
✅ Automatic saving of the best model based on validation accuracy  
✅ Supports training on **CPU** or **GPU (CUDA)**
